the first thing we want to do is build the scaffolding for our website

learn what needs to be a part of the .vue and what can be imported as a component to be rendered
across pages

h2: title for particular view
p: text for view
button 1, 2, 3: toggle between p to be rendered in the view
button 4: reactive button based on state of view
  if 1: button 4 enables full editing with max char count
  imports the summary from smmry.com as template text
  if 2: can only delete + revert
  if 3: can only highlight, comment on original text
